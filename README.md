# Optimisation Model for Wireless Charging Lanes
This repository contains the project for the course of "Mathematical Optimisation" @ UniTS, consisting in the realisation of the paper [Dynamic wireless charging lanes location model in urban networks considering route choices](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X2200095X) by Tran et al. (2022).

In particular, in contains:
- a file test.py where all the proposed algorithms (model + potential heuristics) are executed on small instances
- a file scalability.py to be used for the scalability analysis of the algorithms
- the final presentation
